            <p>Looking for learning resources like books can be expensive for some students. It will be also such a waste if we just leave those used books untouched after using them for just a semester or two. Put some good use on those books by selling them to our website. <br> <br>Mytbook strives to be your one-stop shop for searching for books you needed for school. Search for the book you needed and set up a prefered meet up that suits your best availability.

            <h4 class="content-sub"> Good Price, Good Condition</h4> 
            <p>Don't just settle for expensive books because you can't find a reliable source of cheap but still in a good condition book. In Mytbook, you will not only get good quality books, but you can also get them on an affordable and negotiable price whenever and wherever.<br><br> Mytbook offers a wide variety of books available for students made by other BCIT students themselves!.

With one simple search, youâ€™ll get connected to your fellow BCIT students who sell the book you are looking for an affordable book that is obviously a lot cheaper than their original price. In Mytbook we made it easier for customers to:<br><br>1. Directly send a message to the book owner through the app.<br> 2. meet up with the book owner based on their posted preferred meeting date whether inside or outside the campus.
